   ## Key Insights
- Revenue trends closely mirrored order trends, indicating volume-driven growth.
- Average Order Value remained stable year-over-year (-0.34%), suggesting consistent customer spending behavior. The slight downward trend, indicates mild price sensitivity or lower-value purchases.
- A small group of top customers contributes a significant share of total revenue, indicating revenue concentration risk.
- The store’s revenue is heavily driven by a single genre, Rock.
- Artist sales follow a power-law distribution, where a few artists generate most revenue.
- 2019 represents a performance peak across multiple KPIs, followed by a decline in 2020.
- The customer base is relatively small, but engagement is high.

## Final Conclusion:
Customer spending behavior is stable over time, with growth driven by more customers and higher purchase frequency rather than increased spend per transaction. While customer retention is strong, revenue is highly concentrated among a small group of customers, artists, genres (especially Rock), and regions, creating both risk and opportunity. 2019 stands out as a benchmark year, and sustainable growth will depend on customer acquisition, protecting high-value segments, and diversifying revenue sources.
